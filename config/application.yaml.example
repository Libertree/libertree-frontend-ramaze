# Websocket settings
#
# The websocket server should only be bound to localhost, not 0.0.0.0.
# You need to configure your proxying web server to forward requests
# on http://domain.of.your.tree.com:80/ws to the websocket server
# spawned by the backend process, which listens by default on
# localhost:8080.
#
# If you choose to expose the websocket server to the Internet and
# make it listen on 0.0.0.0:8080, you need to set websocket_port to
# 8080.  This is not recommended.
